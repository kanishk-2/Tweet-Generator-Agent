### üß† Agentic AI Summary

This project uses the Gemini model in a simple, agent-like manner. Each button click triggers a specific, specialized AI function, effectively creating a suite of user-directed "agents" for different tasks: one for generating tweets, another for suggesting hashtags, and a third for transforming text (summarizing or expanding). This modular approach allows the AI to act as a powerful, multi-purpose tool under direct human control.

* **Tailwind CSS:** For fast and efficient styling.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For the core application logic and API interactions.
* **Google Gemini API:** The generative AI model behind all the tweet and hashtag creation.
